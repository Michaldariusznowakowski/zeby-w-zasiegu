The development of instant messengers has significantly simplified long-distance conversations and has strongly influenced the development of online applications responsible for booking appointments and consultations between doctors and patients. However, securing data in such applications turned out to be a challenge. The aim of this thesis is to develop a web application that ensures the security of messages and files sent between a dentist and a patient.
